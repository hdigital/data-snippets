## UK 2024 election

In the [2024 United Kingdom general election](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_United_Kingdom_general_election#Full_results)
Labour won a **33.7% vote share** and gained a **63.2% seat share**. Compared to the
[2019 UK election](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_United_Kingdom_general_election#Full_results),
it increased its vote share by 3.2% and its seat share by 27.3%.

Majoritarian electoral systems convert votes into seats disproportionally and
provide a seats bonus for the winning party. However, the votes-seats ratio
of the Labour party in the 2024 election is rather high.

Among more than 600 majoritarian elections in democratic regimes between 1900
and 2020 it is **one of the highest votes-seats difference**
([see below](#top-2-majoritarian)).

Here, I provide a brief overview of the votes-seats translation for majoritarian
electoral systems (first-past-the-post and two-round) in democratic regimes,
following the V-Dem classifications.

For some background on electoral systems around the world, see the notebooks
about [types](https://hdigital.github.io/data-snippets/notebooks/2021_electoral-systems_types.nb.html)
and [evolution](https://hdigital.github.io/data-snippets/notebooks/2021_electoral-systems_evolution.nb.html)
of electoral systems since 1900.

library(tidyverse)

## V-Party data

Election results are from [V-Party](https://v-dem.net/data/v-party-dataset/) (v2)
and electoral systems classifications from
[V-Dem](https://v-dem.net/data/v-party-dataset/) (v11.1).

For the analysis, election results are selected for all majoritarian electoral systems
(first-past-post and two round) in democratic regimes since 1900 (V-Dem classifications).

## UK elections

### Con ¬∑ Lab ¬∑ Lib

UK election results for Conservatives, Labour, and Liberals from 1900 to 2024
with 2024 results added from [BBC News](https://www.bbc.com/news/election/2024/uk/results).

```{r}
uk_3 <- read_csv("data/uk-elections_top-3_vparty.csv")
```

Seat and vote share of three main parties in the UK.

```{r}
pl <-
  ggplot(uk_3, aes(x = year, color = party)) +
  geom_line(aes(y = seat_share)) +
  geom_point(aes(y = seat_share, shape = "Seats")) +
  geom_line(aes(y = vote_share), alpha = 0.3) +
  geom_point(aes(y = vote_share, shape = "Votes"), alpha = 0.6) +
  labs(x = "Year", y = "Share (%)", color = "Party", shape = "Share") +
  scale_color_manual(values = c(
    "Lab" = "red",
    "Con" = "blue",
    "Lib" =  "#DAA520"
  )) +
  scale_shape_manual(values = c("Seats" = 16, "Votes" = 1))

ggsave("figures/elections-uk.png", plot = pl, width = 10, height = 6, dpi = 300)
pl
```

### Votes-Seats differences

Two highest seat share **gains** through positive votes-seats ratio by party.

```{r}
uk_3 |>
  slice_max(order_by = share_diff, n = 2, by = c(party)) |>
  select(party, year, share_gain = share_diff, seat_share, vote_share) |>
  arrange(party, desc(share_gain))
```

Seat share **losses** through negative votes-seats ratio.

```{r}
uk_3 |>
  slice_min(order_by = share_diff, n = 2, by = c(party)) |>
  select(party, year, share_loss = share_diff, seat_share, vote_share) |>
  arrange(party, share_loss)
```

### Share changes

Two highest vote share **gains** compared to previous election and seat share change by party.


```{r}
uk_3 |>
  slice_max(order_by = vote_change, n = 2, by = c(party)) |>
  select(party, year, vote_change, vote_share, seats_change, seat_share)
```

Vote share **losses** and seat share change.

```{r}
uk_3 |>
  slice_min(order_by = vote_change, n = 2, by = c(party)) |>
  select(party, year, vote_change, vote_share, seats_change, seat_share)
```

## Majoritarian systems

### Nine countries

Votes-seats differences for the two largest parties in an election.

Nine countries with the highest number of majoritarian elections are presented.

```{r}
top_2 <- read_csv("data/majoritarian-elections_top-2_vparty.csv")
```


```{r}
ctry_count <-
  top_2 |>
  distinct(country, year) |>
  count(country, sort = TRUE)


pl <-
  top_2 |>
  filter(country %in% ctry_count[["country"]][1:9]) |>
  ggplot(aes(x = year, color = rank)) +
  geom_line(aes(y = seat_share)) +
  geom_point(aes(y = seat_share, shape = "Seats")) +
  geom_line(aes(y = vote_share), alpha = 0.3) +
  geom_point(aes(y = vote_share, shape = "Votes"), alpha = 0.6) +
  labs(x = "Year", y = "Share (%)", color = "Party", shape = "Share") +
  facet_wrap(vars(country_name))

ggsave("figures/elections-majoritarian.png",
  plot = pl, width = 10, height = 6, dpi = 300
)
pl
```

### Votes-seats

Votes and seats share differences in majoritarian democratic elections.

```{r}
vparty_elec <- read_csv("data/majoritarian-elections_vparty.csv")

pl1 <-
  ggplot(vparty_elec, aes(x = vote_share, y = share_diff, colour = elec_sys)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.3) +
  guides(colour = "none")

pl2 <-
  ggplot(vparty_elec, aes(x = share_diff, colour = elec_sys)) +
  geom_histogram()

pl1 + pl2 + plot_layout(widths = c(3, 2))
```


Highest vote/seat share difference for all democratic regimes with majoritarian elections.

```{r}
top_2 |>
  slice_max(order_by = share_diff, n = 1, by = c(country)) |>
  select(country, country_name, year, party, vote_share, seat_share, share_diff) |>
  arrange(desc(share_diff)) |>
  reactable(searchable = TRUE, striped = TRUE)
```
