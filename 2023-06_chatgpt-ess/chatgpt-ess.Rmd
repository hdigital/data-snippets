## Read data

```{r}
ess_data_raw <- haven::read_dta("ESS9e03_1.dta")
ess_data <- ess_data_raw
```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
ess_data_raw <- haven::read_sav("ESS9e03_1.sav")
ess_data <- ess_data_raw
```

```{r}
names(ess_data)
```


```{r}
glimpse(ess_data)
```


## Descriptive statistics

```{r}
ggplot(ess_data, aes(x = agea)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 5, fill = "steelblue", color = "white") +
  labs(title = "Distribution of Age in ESS 2018", x = "Age", y = "Count")
```
```{r}
table(ess_data$vote)
```

```{r}
# Convert "vote" variable to a factor
ess_data$vote <- factor(ess_data$vote)

# Create a cross-table for "vote" by country using dplyr
ess_data %>%
  group_by(cntry) %>%
  summarise(voted = sum(vote == "Yes", na.rm = TRUE),
            did_not_vote = sum(vote == "No, did not vote", na.rm = TRUE),
            refused = sum(vote == "Refused", na.rm = TRUE),
            dk = sum(vote == "Don't know", na.rm = TRUE),
            na = sum(is.na(vote)))
```

ChatGPT assumed that the factor conversion kept the label

```{r, eval=FALSE}
ess_data <- ess_data_raw

# Create a cross-table for "vote" by country using dplyr
ess_data %>%
  group_by(cntry) %>%
  summarise(voted = sum(vote == 1, na.rm = TRUE),
            did_not_vote = sum(vote == 2, na.rm = TRUE),
            refused = sum(vote == 3, na.rm = TRUE),
            dk = sum(vote == 4, na.rm = TRUE),
            na = sum(is.na(vote)),
            share = round(100 *voted / (voted + did_not_vote))
            ) %>%
  arrange(desc(share))
```


## Turnout model

```{r}
# Recode "vote" variable as 1, 0, or NA
ess_data <-
  ess_data %>%
  mutate(voted = case_when(
    vote == 1 ~ 1,
    vote == 2 ~ 0,
    TRUE ~ NA_real_,),
    sex = ifelse(gndr == 1, 1, 0)
  )

# Run logistic regression model with "vote" as the outcome variable and "agea" and "gndr" as predictors
model <- glm(voted ~ agea , data = ess_data, family = binomial)

# Print summary of model results
summary(model)
```

```{r}
# Calculate predicted probabilities and confidence intervals using ggpredict
prob_ci <- ggpredict(model, terms = "agea", type = "re")

# Plot predicted probabilities and confidence intervals using ggplot
ggplot(prob_ci, aes(x = x, y = predicted)) +
  geom_line(color = "blue") +
  geom_ribbon(aes(ymin = conf.low, ymax = conf.high), alpha = 0.3) +
  labs(title = "Predicted Probability of Voting by Age",
       x = "Age", y = "Predicted Probability")
```
```{r}
# Run logistic regression model with "vote" as the outcome variable and predictors
model <- glm(voted ~ agea + sex , data = ess_data, family = binomial)

# Create effects plot for age, controlling for gender
plot <- ggpredict(model, terms = c("agea", "sex"))

# Plot the effects of age on voter turnout
plot(plot)
```

```{r}
summary(model)
```

```{r}
# Fit logistic regression model
model <- glm(voted ~ agea + sex + cntry, data = ess_data, family = binomial)

# Create effects plot for age, gender, and country
plot <- ggpredict(model, terms = c("cntry", "sex"))

# Plot the effects of age on voter turnout
plot(plot)
```

### Interaction effect

```{r}
# Fit logistic regression model
model <- glm(voted ~ agea * sex + cntry, data = ess_data, family = binomial)

# Create effects plot for age, gender, and their interaction
plot <- ggpredict(model, terms = c("agea", "sex"))

# Plot the effects of age on voter turnout
plot(plot)
```

```{r}
summary(model)
```
```{r}
nagelkerke(model)
```
```{r}
# Extract model coefficients and standard errors into a tidy data frame
model_summary <- tidy(model, exponentiate = TRUE)

# View the tidy data frame
model_summary
```


```{r}
# Extract model summary statistics using broom::glance
glance(model)
```


## Multi-level model

```{r}
# Model with interaction effect
model <- glmer(voted ~ agea * sex + (1|cntry), data = ess_data, family = binomial)

# Summary of the model
summary(model)
```


```{r}
# Create effects plot for age, gender, and their interaction
plot <- ggpredict(model, terms = c("agea", "sex"))

# Plot the effects of age on voter turnout
plot(plot)
```
```{r}
fivenum(ess_data$agea, na.rm = TRUE)
table(ess_data$sex)
cor(ess_data$agea, ess_data$sex, use = "complete.obs")
```
```{r}
# Create a new column centered_age that is the age variable minus its mean
ess_data <-
  ess_data %>%
  group_by(cntry) %>%
  mutate(age_c = agea - mean(agea, na.rm = TRUE))

# Model with interaction effect
model <- glmer(voted ~ age_c * sex + (1|cntry), data = ess_data, family = binomial)

# Summary of the model
summary(model)
```
